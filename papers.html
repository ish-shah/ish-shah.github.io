        <p>
            Here is a selected collection of notes I have written and nicely typeset. Some of these are from coursework or other academic projects, and some of these were written for instruction purposes.

                        This expository paper was constructed from notes taken during my directed reading program I did in the spring 2024 semester, mentored by PhD student Nicholas Backes. It provides a summary of what I read on the prime number theorem, primarily from <em>Complex Analysis</em> by Stein and Shakarchi, that semester.

                        This is one of the supplemental materials I provided students in the algorithms course I served as a teaching assistant for in the Fall 2024 semester with. This served as optional reading to familiarize themselves with greedy algorithms beyond the examples covered in class.
