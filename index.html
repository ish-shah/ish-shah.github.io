                    I am a final-year undergraduate student at Rutgers University studying mathematics. You can reach me by email: <strong>irs51 [at] scarletmail [dot] rutgers [dot] edu</strong>.

                <p>
                    Within mathematics, I am primarily interested in analysis. Subfields of analysis I take interest in currently include harmonic analysis, analytic number theory, and geometric measure theory.
                    In the summer of 2025, I participated in the Clemson University REU in Number Theory, where I was mentored by Hui Xue and Tianyu Ni on a project relating to modular forms and combinatorial identities.
                    Previously, in the summer of 2024, I participated in the DIMACS REU at Rutgers, where I was mentored by Mariusz Mirek and Leonidas Daskalakis on a project combining harmonic analysis, analytic number theory, and ergodic theory.
                    Before that, I worked on a project through the Aresty Research Assistant Program at Rutgers, where I was mentored by Shadi Tahvildar-Zadeh on a project about the stability of Hamiltonians for the wave equation in one dimension.
