        <p>
            Here is a selected collection of notes I have written and nicely typeset. Some of these are from coursework or other academic projects, and some of these were written for instruction purposes.

                <em>Notes on the Prime Number Theorem</em>, available <a href="pnt_notes.pdf">here</a>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This expository paper was constructed from notes taken during my directed reading program I did in the spring 2024 semester, mentored by PhD student Nicholas Backes. It provides a summary of what I read on the prime number theorem, primarily from <em>Complex Analysis</em> by Stein and Shakarchi, that semester.

                        This is one of the supplemental materials I provided students in the algorithms course I served as a teaching assistant for in the Fall 2024 semester with. This served as optional reading to familiarize themselves with greedy algorithms beyond the examples covered in class.
